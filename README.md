## Live Link
The project is still in development but as soon as it goes live a link to the deployed site will be provided.

## About the project
The WEC HR Management System is a digital personal assistant web application that helps relieve some of the tedious human resource related work for the HR professionals at Willfreight Express Cargo. 

The web application helps manage employee functions like calculating and communicating time-off, onboarding paperwork, and managing employee performanceâ€”which lets HR at the company focus on more important, strategic work. 

Some of the features offered by the WEC HR Management System include; employee management, employee leave and time-off management, employee appraisal management and employee attendance management and analytics.

The React code for the web application -- that interacts with a REST API backend developed in Laravel -- can be found within this repository.

## Technologies used
The technology stack used for this project is as follows:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the development
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for the client side routing
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling the React components
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for the mockups and designs

## Setup
First, fork the repository using your Github account.

Once you have forked the repository, you can clone the code directly onto your local machine using the `git clone` command.

On your machine, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install all of the node module dependencies needed to run the application. 

The terminal may prompt you to run `npm audit fix`. I recommend you run `npm audit fix --force` to get rid of any errors.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
